## Scenario
Once upon a time.. nope!  
So here, you have been temporarily hired by Omise and assigned to work on the charity donation project which the previously assigned front-end developer and designer got the urgent matters to solve, so they will not be able to finish the project on time..

Fortunately, the API server is already done. You will need to grab on the requirements and complete the project while ensuring the application to have great engineering and well-design âœ¨

## Rules
Desire to win the war? Well, to make it a little more fun, please remember that

**You cannot:**
- Change existing behaviors.
- Change the API server.
- Change from JS to other languages.

**In the other hand, feel free to:**
- Improve the design to have better UI and UX.
- Re-organize the codebase.
- Create new modules/methods/components.
- Modify existing code.
- Add new packages.
- Update `webpack` config.
- Take reasonable time to complete the challenge, no need to rush.
- Edit `README.md` to add documentation. What have you done or how to run or test your app?


**Note**: You can see design inside folder `resources`.


## Surprise us!
Ready to surprise us what you have done? Email your changes as a [git format-patch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch) to theesit@omise.co
Please remember that your patch must consist of multiple separate commits. Your commit message must communicate clearly what has been done in each commit.

If you notice more bugs in the original implementation you can add fixes for those as well. You won't be penalized if you don't. However we ask you not to add more features than the one given in the mission list.

Let's rock! :metal:

### Use Hygen Code Generator For Generating Components

Step 1: Install Hygen Globally into your system using
